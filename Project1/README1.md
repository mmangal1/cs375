Program1 is to find the LCS of sequences given in filex.txt and filey.txt
This is a bottom up dynamic approach to solve LCS

If the length of sequences provided in either filex.txt or filey.txt is greater than 10 then the program will
only print the length of the LCS and the running time of algorithm

Else it will provide a table of values corresponding with the LCS table, a longest common subsequence, and the running time of algorithm

filex.txt and filey.txt must be provided in the same directory

Compile program1:
make program1

Run program1:
./program1 <filex.txt> <filey.txt> <output.txt>
