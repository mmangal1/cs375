Program3 is to find the length LCS of sequences given in filex.txt and filey.txt
This is a recursive approach to solve LCS with memoization

This program will print the length of LCS of given subsequences followed by the time of the running algorithm

filex.txt and filey.txt must be provided in the same directory

Compile program3:
make program3

Run program2:
./program3 <filex.txt> <filey.txt> <output.txt>
